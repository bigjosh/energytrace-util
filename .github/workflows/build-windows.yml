            Two builds are provided:
            - **energytrace-x86.exe** — 32-bit, for use with 32-bit MSP430.DLL (most common, e.g. Code Composer Studio)
            - **energytrace-x64.exe** — 64-bit, for use with 64-bit MSP430.DLL

            ### Requirements
            - **MSP430 Debug Stack (MSP430.DLL)** must be installed.
              Download from [TI's MSP Debug Stack](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSPDS) or install as part of Code Composer Studio.
            - Place `MSP430.DLL` in the same directory as the exe, or ensure it is on your system PATH.
            - Use the exe that matches your MSP430.DLL architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

            ### Usage
            ```
            energytrace-x86.exe <measurement duration in seconds>
            ```
